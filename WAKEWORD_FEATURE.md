# Wakeword/Voice Chat Feature

## Overview

The wakeword feature enables hands-free, voice-based interaction with Zobo using speech recognition. Users can activate voice chat by saying specific wakewords and have natural conversations with Zobo using their voice.

## Features

### Wakeword Detection
- **Supported wakewords**: "Hey Zobo" or "Zobo"
- **Continuous listening**: When enabled, Zobo continuously listens for wakewords in the background
- **Privacy-first**: No audio data is sent to servers until a wakeword is detected

### Voice Chat
- **Speech-to-text**: Your voice is converted to text using the browser's built-in speech recognition
- **Text-to-speech**: Zobo's responses are spoken back using browser speech synthesis
- **Natural conversation**: Seamless voice interaction that feels like talking to a friend

## How to Use

### Enabling Wakeword Listening
1. Click the **microphone-alt button** (ðŸŽ¤) in the header to toggle wakeword listening
2. When enabled, the button will show "Disable Wakeword"
3. When disabled, the button will show "Enable Wakeword"

### Voice Interaction
1. **Enable wakeword listening** using the toggle button
2. **Say the wakeword**: "Hey Zobo" or just "Zobo"
3. **Wait for the prompt**: Zobo will start listening for your message
4. **Speak your message**: Ask your question or make your request
5. **Listen to the response**: Zobo will respond with voice

### Example Conversation
```
You: "Hey Zobo"
[Zobo starts listening]
You: "What's the weather like today?"
Zobo: "I'd be happy to help with weather information, but I don't have access to real-time weather data..."
```
